Project 5 for MSCH-C220

## Implementation

Built using Godot 3.5
Player navigates a procedurely generated maze with their magic wand, fending off monsters and finding a way out. The required csg would be a piece of cheese the player would pick up that would let them leave. 

This project frustrated me a lot. No matter what it seemed like I couldn't get anything to work. The maze was pretty simple to set up since we had an exercise focused on doing that. I was able to import the staff model and the monster models but couldn't ever get the textures to show up. My first big issue was trying to get the player to shoot a fireball. At first I tried to make the game instance a fireball everytime the player pressed the shoot button but could never get it to show up. It would just make the screen blink a bunch and then nothing would happen. So I moved on to trying to make it a raycast instead of a projectile. Same issue. 

After a long while I just moved on to the next thing which was the monsters. I wanted them to spawn throughout the level. I followed your youtube video to do that and the monsters would spawn but all be in the same relative position. 

I should have started earlier on this. I even took an extra day past the due date to try and get it too work. I'm really sorry for the product I turned in. I would love any input on how to make my code better.
